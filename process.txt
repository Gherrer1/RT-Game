1. So Rotten Tomatoes (RT) doesn't offer an API easily. There's a whole application process. My project is purely for instructive purposes so I
   dont think they'd approve my application. So I'll web scrape for now.

2. RT is probably aware that people will try to scrape, so I think that is why they send back HTML without the movie data already rendered.
   Instead, they include a script that takes the movie data JSON and inserts it into the DOM. This *was* good anti-scraping defense for a
   little while, but I found the script pattern in the html and used regex to extract that JSON data.
   With this data, I can not only read the score for the movie I was searching for but also the scores for related movies.
   ex) Searching for spider man will give me results for the all the toby mcguire spidermans, the forgettable andrew garfield spidermans, and the tom holland movie.
